# Role-Playing Games Teaching Negotiation Skills

## Project Description

This project is a **Role-Playing Game (RPG)** that helps players improve their **negotiation skills** through a simulated negotiation environment on the Ethereum blockchain. The game allows players to take on roles such as Buyer, Seller, and Mediator, where they negotiate terms, make offers, and reach agreements or raise disputes. The game's primary goal is to help users practice real-world negotiation strategies in a fun and interactive environment.

The game includes features such as:
- Player registration with defined roles.
- Negotiations between players (Buyer and Seller).
- A Mediator who helps finalize the agreement.
- A dispute resolution process.

This is a decentralized application (DApp) that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency, fairness, and immutability of the game’s logic and results.
